We have gathered resources from our experience and from our fellow candidates placed at McKinsey & \\nCo., Kearney, BCG, Dalberg, L. E. K. Consulting, Kepler Cannon, Accenture Strategy, Zomato, Bain & Company, etc. This book \\ncontains end -to-end transcripts from the case interviews mentioned above, frameworks related to different case types, and all \\nother details for a candidate to secure a job in the consulting space.\\nWe put our heart and soul into our journeys of preparing for these interviews because of how much we aspired to achieve our \\ngoals. Naturally, we also faced roadblocks at every step. We felt the need to come up with this case book because one of the \\nmajor roadblocks was that there were next to no case books at theundergraduate level , as most of the case books are by post -\\ngraduate students for their college placements only. We had to look for interviews online and contact seniors to know about t heir \\ninterviews. We decided that we wouldn’t want our juniors to spend time and energy in collating these resources before they \\nstarted their actual preparation.\\nWith our aim to reach out to every student, regardless of their background, we will make our book available free of cost so t hatit \\nis just a click away for anyone who needs it. Aligning with our goal, the Placement Cell of SRCC is also lending a helping ha nd in \\nmaking it available to the upcoming batches. \\nLastly, w e would also like to recommend other resources that we used for our preparation -we found Case Interviews Cracked'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"and IIM -A’s case books to be useful references.

Do not make the mistake of reading the cases in the book on your own. Instead, solve cases in pairs. One'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='person usually takes on the role of the ‘interviewer’ and the other, the ‘interviewee’. Only the interviewer must go through the\\ncase to understand the problem. After this, the ‘interviewer’ gives the case to the ‘interviewee’ who makes an attempt to sol ve the \\ncase. Other members of the case group can also be a part of the process by observing the interview. Finally, the members can \\ndiscuss the case and give their individual insights. The interviewee’s solution can be compared to the one in the book to ana lyze \\nthings which could have been approached differently.\\nFEEDBACK\\nA setting where honest, constructive feedback is appreciated is important in order to develop case -solving skills. Be open to pe er \\nfeedback and consult a senior who has gone through the process in case of any clarifications required. Make sure you incorpor ate\\nthe feedback going forward.\\nTOOLS\\nEvery case in this book is accompanied with:\\n▪Clarifying questions: These are a list of important preliminary questions which should be asked in the context of the case. \\nSimilar cases have similar preliminary questions. However, it is important to contextualize the questions with respect to eve ry \\nindividual case.\\n▪Brownie points: One effective way to catch the interviewer’s eye is to mention facts related to the case that not everyone \\nwould think of. This demonstrates your knowledge of the world and ability to think in the moment. Although this is not \\nnecessary, it makes you stand out, giving you an edge over other candidates.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='necessary, it makes you stand out, giving you an edge over other candidates.\\n▪Keep in mind: These are tips that you can incorporate in the way you approach cases. As and when you solve more cases, you \\nwill realize there are certain unsaid rules in the solving process. The ‘keep in mind’ boxes are a good way to improve the wa y \\nyou communicate your solution to the interviewer.PROFITABILITY\\nPRODUCTION DEMAND DISTRIBUTIONFRAMEWORK\\n11A typical profitability problem would look like: “Your profits are down by 20%, analyse the reason for the same by isolating \\nthe problem.”\\nIt is important to begin by understanding the problem better by asking some preliminary questions.

We don’t have information about the other malls.\\nMy approach would be to first find out what has been driving the higher profits and then figure out if this is of a \\nsustainable nature.

There has been an increase in the revenue we make from our parking lot.\\nBefore isolating the cause behind the same, I would like to understand the system a little better.

We can now use the following formula to isolate the cause:\\nRevenue from parking in the month = Number of working days in the month * Average number of cars/day * Flat Rate\\nSince there has been no change in the rate, either the number of working days has been higher or there have been more \\ncars entering our parking facility on an average.INDUSTRY\\nRETAIL\\n32COMPANY\\nBCG\\nROUND\\nMANAGERMall of Fame\\nWalkthrough\\nCASE TYPE\\nPROFITABILITY\\nDIFFICULTYIt is the latter.\\nOkay.\\nAverage number of cars/day = (Number of mall -goers * % coming in cars)/(Number of people/car)\\nDo we know which of the above factors has seen a change?\\nIn fact, the % of mall -goers coming in cars has increased.\\nHmm.

The number of people coming by \\nmetro has reduced significantly. What are the some reasons you can think of that might be causing this?\\nSure.

This is because the station outside our mall has been shut for maintenance. The next closest metro \\nstation from our mall is 5 km away and is inconvenient for people. Why don’t you conclude the case now?\\nMakes sense. The revenue from the mall’s parking lot has seen an increase due to the increase in cars, owing to the \\nunavailability of metro services in the area. Unfortunately, this increase is temporary as people may go back to using the \\nmetro once the maintenance is complete. The mall owner can consider increasing the parking rate until the metro \\nstation reopens to make even higher profits in the short run.INDUSTRY\\nRETAIL\\n33COMPANY\\nBCG\\nROUND\\nMANAGERMall of Fame\\nFramework & Recommendations\\nREVENUE COSTS\\nRECOMMENDATIONS▪Why is increase in \\nrevenues a cause of \\nconcern?\\n▪Suggesting \\nincreasing rates in the \\nshort run\\n▪Formulas are a great \\nway of breaking down \\ncasesClarifying Questions\\nBrownie Points\\nKeep In MindINCREASE IN THE PROFITS OF A MALL\\nEvents Parking Fees RentAds and'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Brownie Points\\nKeep In MindINCREASE IN THE PROFITS OF A MALL\\nEvents Parking Fees RentAds and \\nSponsorships\\nAverage \\nCars/DayNumber Of \\nWorking DaysRatePROFITS\\nAverage Cars/Day = Number Of Mall -Goers X Percentage Coming In Cars X Number Of People/Car\\nCARS INCREASED\\nAuto Metro On Foot BusOther Models Have \\nBecome Less \\nConvenientCars Have Become \\nMore Convenient\\n▪Increasing parking rate in the short run\\n▪Optimising the parking fee structure –opting for an hourly rate rather than a flat rate so that people coming for short duratio ns \\ndon’t stay away34Grey’s Anatomy\\nWalkthrough\\nCOMPANY\\nKEARNEY\\nROUND\\nBUDDYCASE TYPE\\nPROFITABILITY\\nDIFFICULTYINDUSTRY\\nHEALTHCARELet’s start with acase.

Zendaya is a cosmetics manufacturer. The Board of Directors (BOD) isworried about the \\ncompany’s declining sales. Itwants you to diagnose the problem and come up with a turnaround strategy. How \\nwill you go about it?\\nSounds like an interesting case. I would first like to understand the company better and then move on to the problem at \\nhand. What are the product lines Zendaya is involved in? Does the company sell its products pan -India? Also, what are \\nthe distribution channels we use?\\nThe company has four product lines: Nail Polish, Perfumes, Skin Care and Hair Care. They sell their products pan -\\nIndia and use their own as well as third -party distributors.\\nInteresting. It is possible that the decline in profits is specific to certain product lines, geographies or distribution \\nchannels. Do we have data on the same?\\nYes. In fact, there has been a decline in revenues only in our ‘Perfumes’ segment. However, the decline has been \\nuniform across geographies and distribution channels.\\nOkay, that’s helpful. Do we know the magnitude ofdecline? I would also like to know since when Zendaya has been \\nfacing the problem. This will help us understand the nature of decline better.\\nPerfume sales have seen a decline of about 10% over the last 2 years. Is there anything else you would like to \\nknow?\\nYes. Before I proceed with my analysis, I would like to know if other perfume companies have seen a similar decline as'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='well. Also, do we have any segmentation in the perfumes we sell?\\nOther perfume companies seem to be doing fine. We sell perfumes under 2 segments: 1) Mass segment: These \\nperfumes are priced below Rs. 200 and constitute 20% of perfume sales. 2) Premium segment: These perfumes are \\npriced more than Rs.200 and constitute the remaining 80% of perfume sales. The decline is limited to our premium \\nsegment.\\nUnderstood.

I would like to analyse three aspects here: Production, Distribution and Demand. It is possible that we have been \\nfacing issues in production due to labour strikes, factory closure, etc. However, this is unlikely as the decline has been \\ntaking place for two years now.\\nUnder distribution, it would be interesting to know if our distributors are pushing our competitors’ perfumes over ours. \\nThis too is unlikely as all our distribution channels seem to be facing the decline. Lastly, I would like to see if demand fo r \\nour perfumes has seen a decline. This may be due to reasons like unpopular fragrances, negative publicity , etc.\\nYou are right. We have reason to believe our competitors’ perfumes are being preferred by customers. Why do you'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='think this is happening?\\nThere are several reasons why this may be happening. In order to further isolate the problem, I would like to look at 5 \\nmajor drivers of demand: Need, Awareness, Accessibility, Affordability and Experience. Under need, I’m concerned with \\nany change in customer preferences or requirements in the last couple of years. Under awareness , it is important to look \\nat our promotional efforts and see how they compare to our competitors’ in case we believe our target population is not \\naware of our perfumes. Under Accessibility , it is important that our perfumes are easily accessible to the end customers. \\nSince we have multiple distribution channels, this should not be an issue. Affordability may not be very relevant in \\npremium perfumes. However, I would still like to benchmark our prices with our competitors’ prices and see if it is a \\nconcern. Finally, it is also important to analyse customer satisfaction and Experience. Do we know where we are facing \\nan issue?\\nYes. Customers are not very satisfied with Zendaya’s premium perfume. Why don’t you analyse customer \\nexperience?\\nSure. At this point, it makes sense to draw a customer journey and find out at what stage we’re losing them. The first step \\nundertaken by the customer is to make a decision to purchase our perfume. He/she then visits a shop or website where \\nthe perfume is available. Subsequently, the customer navigates the shop or website and locates the perfume. He/she \\nthen completes the purchase by going through the billing process. Now, we come to the usage stage and see how'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='satisfied they are with the product itself. Finally, we must also look at the quality of our customer service and feedback \\nmechanism. Do we know at what stage customers have been expressing dissatisfaction? If not, we can dive deeper into \\neach stage.\\nExcellent. You can limit your analysis to the usage stage.\\nPerfect. There are 4 things I would like to look at in this stage: Packaging, Fragrance, Life of the product and Defect rate.\\nUnder packaging, I would like to know if we or our competitors have made any changes to the type of packaging, size of \\nthe bottle/can and durability. Under fragrance, I am mainly concerned with changes made to the scents as well as \\ningredients used in the perfumes. For instance, it is possible that some ingredients may be inducing allergic reactions. \\n39Make -Up for Lost Profits\\nWalkthrough\\nCOMPANY\\nKEARNEY\\nROUND\\nBUDDYCASE TYPE\\nPROFITABILITY\\nDIFFICULTYINDUSTRY\\nCOSMETICSLife of the product includes both shelf life as well as number of uses of our perfume and if there has been any change \\nobserved.

In order to cut costs, Zendaya decided to replace their glass \\nbottles with plastic bottles. Customers no longer feel that they are using a ‘premium’ product. What would you \\nrecommend?\\nBefore that, I would like to know if the bottles are procured or manufactured in -house.\\nRaw materials are sourced from outside.

To increase profits, she has decided to open a makeup outlet \\ninside the store. She has approached you to decide whether this is a wise decision.\\nSure. I’d like to understand the problem better. Where is her store located? What are the products currently available at \\nher store? Also, how much have profits fallen by in this period?\\nHer store is located in Delhi. She currently sells clothes for men and women. Profits have fallen by 15%.\\nInteresting. Does she manufacture her own clothes or is she a 3rdparty distributor? How much space inside the store is \\nthe makeup outlet going to take?\\nShe is a distributor of clothes and plans to be for makeup as well. The makeup outlet is proposed to take up 20% of \\nthe space in the store.\\nLastly, is there any particular reason for choosing a makeup outlet or is our client open to other ideas as well?\\nShe believes makeup products will sell much better post the pandemic period and hence, this is the only option \\nshe is considering.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='she is considering.\\nI can now begin. Since our client’s objective is to increase profits, I shall evaluate this decision on the basis of the \\nadditional revenues she will earn minus the additional costs she will incur.\\nSure, sounds good,\\nTherefore,  if -Additional Revenues > Additional Costs, this isa wise decision. \\nIn additional costs, I would like to incorporate not just the costs of setting up and buying the products, but also the \\nrevenue foregone from the lost retail apparel space, since this is an opportunity cost.\\nBrilliant. Opportunity costs become a major consideration. Why don’t you find the breakeven point of sales for this \\ndecision in a month? What is the data you would require?\\nSure, I know that Breakeven point of sale = (Fixed cost)/(Sale price –Variable cost)\\nTherefore, I would require the following information:\\n1) Fixed costs involved in setting up the makeup outlet\\n2) Opportunity cost of sales foregone\\n3) Average sale price of a makeup product\\n4) Average cost price of purchasing a makeup item\\n5) Other variable costs involved (Staff, etc.)\\nThat seems comprehensive.

Average sale price of a makeup item would be around Rs. 1,000 and the average cost price would \\nbe Rs. 400. The other variable costs per product would come up to Rs. 100.\\nGreat! Since the costs have been given to us in terms of a one -time fixed expenditure and a daily opportunity cost; we \\nwill first find the break -even point where we will be able to recover the fixed cost incurred. Subsequently, we will \\ncalculate the number of products we will need to sell daily in order to experience an incremental profit.\\nCalculating daily opportunity cost -If income is uniform, then every 1 sq. ft of the apparel segment contributes Rs 2.5 (Rs. \\n25,000/10,000). Since the makeup division is expected to take up 2000 sq. ft, the revenue lost would be equal to 2000 Sq. \\nft x Rs 2.5 = Rs. 5,000 per day.\\nThus, total cost to be recovered = Rs. 40,000. Rs. 5,000 everyday the store is open is the opportunity cost.\\n(Calculation on next page)\\nThus, we realise that we need to sell 80 items on an average from our makeup outlet to recover the fixed cost of \\nrenovations and we need to sell 10 products daily to recover the opportunity cost of giving up on 20% of the apparel \\nsegment.\\nBrilliant!

You are required to advise them on whether they should enter the market and if yes, how?\\nIt is important to begin with some preliminary questions. Some important questions for market entry cases are –\\n1)What does the client do? What are the current geographies they operate in? \\n2)Have they entered similar markets in the past?\\n3)Why are they looking to enter this market? Are there any other markets they are considering? \\n4)What parameters will the market entry decision be based on?\\n5)When are they looking to enter the market by?\\nBroadly, you can refer to the following framework as a good starting point as you begin with your first couple of market \\nentry cases:\\nMost market entry cases begin with an analysis of the financial attractiveness of the proposed market. MARKET ENTRY\\nFINANCIAL ATTRACTIVENESS RISKS OPERATIONAL FESEABILITY\\nFINANCIAL ATTRACTIVENESS\\nEXPECTED PROFITS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE MARKET GROWTH RATEFRAMEWORK\\n82The following formula will help you get to the expected profits in the market:\\nExpected profits = (Market size (in units) * % Market Share * Profit/unit) –Fixed costs'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Expected profits = (Market size (in units) * % Market Share * Profit/unit) –Fixed costs\\nUsually, the interviewer will ask you to estimate the above figures. Thus, these cases often involve market sizing guesstimat es to \\narrive at the starting figure. Once this is estimated, you can discuss with the interviewer to make an estimate of the percen tage of \\nthe market the firm will be able to capture initially. This will be based on the number of players in the market, how fragmen ted\\nthe market is and the product differentiation that exists.\\nMoving on to the profit/unit, this can be calculated by estimating the variable costs that will go into making the product or\\nrendering the service in question. Lastly, any fixed costs that will be incurred can be reduced from this figure to arrive at the \\nexpected profits.\\nDo keep in mind the market growth rate and competitive landscape before coming to a conclusion on the market’s \\nattractiveness.EXPECTED PROFITS\\n% MARKET SHARE PROFIT/UNIT MARKET SIZE (UNITS) FIXED COSTS\\nSELLING PRICE/UNIT VARIABLE COST/UNITFRAMEWORK\\n83Sometimes, you may be asked to assess the operational feasibility of the proposed business.

No, he does not have supply -side constraints.

Two strategies can be used -increase in hours worked and optimum time brackets chosen\\n2) Area -His biggest advantage is that he can cover a large area through his cart. He can identify hotspots and be there \\nat particular times. For example, near a school or playground.

He can also invite bookings for birthday parties and other gatherings.\\nNext, we move on to increasing revenue per customer.

My approach is going to be divided into 2:\\n1) Consolidating the existing business –Here, we will look at improving the way the tea seller operates and how he can \\nincrease the sales of his items.\\n2) Venturing into new business –Here, we will explore new products he can introduce, new areas/colleges he can enter, \\nnew customer segments he can look at and finally, inorganic growth methods such as partnering with Nescafe, etc.\\nIn addition, we can also look at ways to eliminate the Nescafe threat in a different way altogether. We can get the \\nPrincipal to interfere in some way or threaten to close shop if Nescafe continues business. These are not very ethical but \\nare options nevertheless.\\nHahaha. Let’s concentrate on our stall for the time -being.\\nSure. Let’s first look at ways in which we can improve our revenues in our existing business. There are two components to \\nrevenue: Number of items sold and price. Any increase in the prices will further reduce demand. If prices are reduced, it \\nwill not matter much as the customers are turning to Nescafe even though it is more expensive. Therefore, changing our \\nprices may not make sense. Let’s look at how we can increase the number of items sold.\\nHere, we can look at supply -side and demand -side constraints.

Let’s move on to demand.\\nSure. Here, I am interested in 2 things:\\n1) Experience: Can we improve the taste of the items? Can they be served differently to appeal to more people? \\nPerhaps, a cup that insulates the heat so that it is easy to hold the hot cup of tea. \\n2) Place: The tea seller can consider changing the location of the stall as well. Somewhere with more seating area, \\nshade, etc. can be explored. Locations that are at some distance from the Nescafe stall would also make sense. Can a \\nperson go around to classes and sell the tea inside these rooms as well?\\nThe tea seller likes your idea of going around the campus to sell tea. Is there anything else you want to look at?\\nYes. We can now look at new products, new areas/campuses, new customer segments and inorganic growth \\npossibilities.

Under new products, we can look at offering coffee as well. Since our coffee will be cheaper than Nescafe’s, price -\\nsensitive customers will return to our stall. In addition, packet food such as chips, snacks , etc. can be introduced as well. \\nDuring the summer, cool drinks are in demand. Maybe the tea -seller can buy or rent a refrigerator so that he can serve \\nthese as well.\\nLooking at new customer segments, the seller can come up with sugar -free options and classroom delivery for elderly \\nfaculty.\\nShould we look at inorganic growth options as well?\\nThat won’t be needed.

Canolli Inc sources its flour from the US and therefore has superior quality. We can’t do the same. Why'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='don’t we now analyse methods to increase sales?\\nSure. Since sales is equal to Number of customers x Revenue per customer.

I’d like to get a better understanding of the problem. Where is the company located? What is \\ntheir primary objective with this product? Other than the fact that it lasts 3 times as long, is itthe same as normal paints?\\nThe company is located in India. They want to maximise profits. Yes, it is the same as normal paints in all other \\ncharacteristics.\\nOkay. How long have we been in this industry and how have we done so far? I’m also assuming that no other competitor \\nhas a similar product?\\nSure. We have been in the industry for 5 years and have a 25% market share. Yes, we are the only ones to have such \\na product.\\nInteresting. In that case, is the product patented?\\nGood question. Yes, it is.\\nI can think of four approaches to price the paint, a cost -based approach that would allow us to cover the basic costs, a \\ncompetitor -based approach which would give us a benchmark, a value -based approach which would give us an'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='indication on how much people will be willing to spend on our product and finally a demand -supply -based approach, if \\ndata is available.\\nSure. You may proceed.\\nLet us begin with the cost -based approach. To develop this new type of paint, we must have incurred significant R&D \\nexpenditure. Do we have any information on the cost incurred?\\nGood question. You can say that we incurred an R&D expenditure of Rs 1 crore to develop this paint.\\nDo we know if there are variable cost additions, such as a special liquid that has to be added to every litre of paint? Also, \\ndo we have a time period or quantity by which we want to recover the R&D expenditure?\\nSure. We incur an additional Rs. 10,000 for every 100 litres of paint manufactured. We would want to recover the \\nfixed investment within the first 50,000 litres of paint sold. All other costs are similar to normal paints.\\nThis gives us an additional variable cost of Rs. 100 (Rs. 10,000/100) per litre manufactured. \\nAccording to me, an average litre of paint costs Rs. 350. I am not too familiar with the industry. Is it okay to assume that \\nthe margin is 15% in the industry?\\n. 128Paint The Town Red\\nWalkthrough\\nCOMPANY\\nKEARNEY\\nROUND\\nPARTNERCASE TYPE\\nPRICING\\nDIFFICULTYINDUSTRY\\nCHEMICALSFair assumption.\\nThat gives us the cost to make 1 litre of paint as approximately Rs. 300. Adding the additional variable cost of Rs. 100, we \\narrive at a total variable cost of Rs. 400. We also need to recover the R&D expenditure within 50,000 litres . Rs. 1,00,00,000'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='divided by 50,000 gives us an additional Rs. 200 to be recovered. That brings our total cost to Rs. 600/ litre. This sets the \\nlower limit that we can charge for the product.\\nGreat. What next?\\nWe cannot do competitor -based pricing since we are the only manufacturers of this type of product. However, since very \\nsimilar products exist, we can do a simple conversion to see the approximate price if a competitor existed. Since a one -\\ntime use of the paint costs Rs. 350/ litre, we would need to use the normal paint 3 times over a given time frame to \\nachieve the same results. This gives us a cost of Rs. 350 x 3 = Rs. 1,050. We also need to consider the labour costs of \\napplying the paint two more times. Assuming an average of around Rs. 25/ litre (The average painter makes Rs. 750 per \\nday of work and applies about 30 litres of paint in this duration). We get Rs. 25 x 2 = Rs. 50 as the additional labour cost. \\nThis gives us an approximate cost of Rs. 1,100. This amount is an approximate benchmark for the price we can charge. \\nWe, however, need to keep in mind the time value of money.\\nGood. You can proceed.\\nNext, in the value -based approach, I would try to understand the monetary value attached to a product like this by \\nconsumers. \\nLet us compare this to a similar product, pens. When companies came out with pens that lasted twice as long, \\ncustomers were willing to spend around 1.5 times the amount they would spend on an ordinary pen. \\nKeeping the same logic in mind, a paint that last 3 times as long, would be valued twi ce as much by customers.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='This is done keeping in mind the following points –The time value of money and a larger investment right now would \\nseem undesirable and the fact that preferences change with time. Also, choosing a paint colour for three times the \\nduration might be too long -term of a decision to make.\\nThus, a 2x multiple of the normal cost of Rs. 350 gives us Rs. 700/ litre.\\nDo we have any information on demand/supply variables?\\nNo, we do not.

In order to do this, the government can consider \\npassing laws to make digital payments compulsory in certain cases, for example, payments larger than Rs. 20,000 can’t \\nbe made in cash. One advantage of digital payments is the fact that there is no problem of loose change.

With elections approaching, the Mayor \\nwould like your advice on how the criminal activity can be brought under control.\\nSounds like an interesting problem.

Is that right?\\nCorrect.\\nAlright. Before we do that, I would like to know what we mean by an increase in criminal activity. Have the number of \\ncrimes committed gone up?\\nYes, that is right.\\nOkay. Do we know how much crimes have increased by and since when this has been happening? Also, have other \\nstates faced a similar problem?'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='states faced a similar problem?\\nCrime rates have gone up by 20% in the last 4 months. Other states have not faced such an issue.\\nThat is a cause for concern. I believe the State will have a segmentation of the different types of crimes –thefts, \\nkidnappings, homicides, sexual harassment, etc. Have all types of crimes gone up or is it specific to some? It is also \\npossible that certain ethnicities or groups are being targeted.\\nHomicides have been increasing off -late. We don’t have a segmentation of our victims. Other crimes have been \\nsteadily decreasing due to the new CCTV cameras installed across the City.\\nThat’s intriguing. Homicides have seen an increase despite the CCTV cameras. We can get to the number of homicides \\nby constructing the following formula:\\nNumber of homicides = Population of Houston * % that are criminals * % of criminals that commit homicides * Number of \\nhomicides per criminal\\nIt is unlikely that the population of Houston has seen a significant increase in such a short period. However, it is possible\\nthat the % of criminals have seen an increase because of factors such as the formation of a new gang. However, since \\nother crimes have seen a decline, my hypothesis is that there has been an increase in the % of criminals that commit \\nhomicides as well as the number of homicides per criminal.

Some common ways in which a \\nperson can be murdered are poisoning, shooting and stabbing. Do we know if there has been an increase in a specific \\nmanner of killing?\\nYes. The number of shootings has increased.\\nHmm. This could either be because of an increase in motives to commit homicides or a more facilitative environment \\nwhich makes it easier to carry out these shootings. Motives can be furthered divided into monetary motives like stealing \\njewelry, securing control of new territory, etcor non -monetary such as hate crimes, revenge, etc. A facilitative \\nenvironment could mean poor law enforcement such as inefficient policemen, reduction in punishments, etc. or easier \\naccess to weapons, in this case –guns.\\nExcellent. 4 months ago, Texas passed a law making it easier to procure a gun license. This has resulted in an \\nincreasing number of shootings. What should the authorities do now?\\nFirst, I would like to know the reason behind the new law.\\nThe rationale behind the new law was that families would be better able to defend themselves against intruders if \\nthey had a gun at home.\\nMakes sense. This has probably been a factor behind the reduction in other crimes. I would suggest a two -step approach \\nto tackle the problem. First, the law must be reconsidered. Other ways such as night patrolling by policemen and'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='installing CCTV cameras within houses can be considered as alternatives to the threats posed by intruders . Second, since \\nthere has already been an increase in the number of guns with criminals, there has to be an attempt to seize these guns \\nagain and clamp down on the criminals. Conducting psychological tests and checking previous criminal records would \\nbe one method. We can explore this further if needed.\\nThat will not be necessary.

As a standalone estimate or as part of a market entry case. Keep in mind, it is not the final \\nanswer, but how you reach your final answer that matters.\\nAn example of a guesstimate would be –”Estimate the number of washing machines sold in a year.”\\nImportant questions you can ask before you begin:\\n1)Over what time period and in which location am I estimating this amount?\\n2)If you are estimating market size, clarify if you need to estimate it in terms of units sold or revenue generated\\n3)Clarify the industry and price point in case you are unfamiliar to better arrive at the final answer'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Note: To make things easier for you, ask the interviewer if you can assume a standard size product for the purpose of this ca se.For \\ne.g. in the washing machine example, there are numerous price ranges and types of washing machines sold In India.

Hence, assume an average price and a standard -size washing machine to be the only type\\nsold.\\nThere are two common ways to begin a guesstimate –Demand side and Supply side\\nDemand Side: As the name suggests, you aim to estimate the total demand for the product/service assuming there are no supply \\nside constraints.

For e.g. Number of \\nBurgers sold in McDonald’s outlet in Connaught Place.

To calculate the number of trains/line, we can look at the frequency of trains\\nand make an estimate of the time it takes the train to complete the trip from the first station to the last station on the \\nline.\\nI travel to college on the yellow line. There is one train which comes every 4 minutes in peak hours. We are only \\nconcerned by the frequency in peak hours since our objective is to find the maximum number of trains in use at any \\npoint during the day. This will essentially give us the fleet size. The journey from the first stop to the last stop of the y ellow'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='line takes about 80 minutes. However, I think the yellow line is one of the longer lines in the metro network. After \\nadjusting for this, we can say that the average metro route can be covered in about 60 minutes.\\nNumber of trains/line = Total time taken to complete journey/Frequency of trains\\nTherefore, the number of trains/line is about 15. However, we still have to take one thing into consideration. These 15 \\ntrains are going in one direction. There are another 15 which will be going in the opposite direction at the same time. \\nThus, we are left with 30 trains/line. Finally, we can multiply it with the total number of lines in Delhi, i.e., 10.\\nHence, the active fleet size of Delhi metro = 10 * 30 = 300.\\nGood job.Most guesstimates don’t \\nfall under a specific \\nindustry, hence an open \\nmind always helps \\n198Subway Surfers\\nFramework \\n▪What do we mean by \\nfleet size?\\n▪Are we concerned \\nonly with the active \\nfleet size?\\n▪Incorporating own \\ntravelling experience \\nto make more \\naccurate assumptions\\n▪It is easier to solve \\nguesstimates if you \\ncan visualise the \\nproblem at hand\\n▪Account for only peak \\nhours while \\ncalculating the fleet \\nsizeClarifying Questions\\nBrownie Points\\nKeep In MindFLEET SIZE OF DELHI METRO\\nNO.

You are required to estimate the volume of Pepsi sold in a cricket game at the \\nWankhede stadium, Mumbai.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Wankhede stadium, Mumbai.\\nOh wow, that’s interesting! Are we talking about an international match, IPL match or Ranji Trophy/domestic \\ntournament match? Also, can I make the assumption that this is pre -covid when crowds were allowed in stadiums? How \\nis the weather during the match?\\nIt is an IPL match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians. Yes, assume the year is 2019. It is a \\npleasant evening –not too cold and not too hot.\\nOkay. I can begin now. My formula would be as follows –\\nTotal volume of Pepsi sold = Total number of seats * % occupancy * % that purchase a soft drink * % that purchase Pepsi * \\nVolume purchased by each person\\nI would first estimate the total number of people that can be accommodated by the stadium. Wankhede is an average -\\nsized stadium in India. By my understanding, it has around 8 stands and an average of 4,000 seats in each stand. This \\nwould give us a total capacity of 32,000 seats in the stadium.\\nConsidering it is a high -profile match with popular players on both sides, it would be reasonable to assume a 90% \\noccupancy rate.\\nTo estimate the percentage that would buy a soft drink, I would like to look at 3 filters –Income, Health, Mood.\\nSince around 4 out of the 8 stands have affordable tickets, we can assume that these are people that are budget \\nconscious and considering a glass of Pepsi is expensive inside a stadium, we can rule them out from purchasing the \\ndrink (The logic is similar to a movie theatr e where middle class consumers are reluctant to spend on soft drinks) . There'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='also exists a percentage of people that avoid soft drinks for health reasons. We can assume this percentage to be around \\n30%. Lastly, among the people that can afford and do drink soft drinks, we can assume around 20% to not be interested \\nin a soft drink on the given day. This gives us 50%*70%*80% = 30% (approx.).\\nNext, there are around 4 popular soft drinks. If the preference was uniform, we would get 25% per drink. However, \\nadjusting for the fact that Pepsi is more popular, we can assume around 40% would purchase Pepsi.\\nLastly, we can assume an average of 1.25 glasses consumed per person (Around 1 glass per person and accounting for 1 in \\n4 people buying 2 glasses). Each glass is around 300ml, so this gives us 375 ml on an average.\\nPutting the numbers into the formula we get -\\nTotal volume of Pepsi sold = 32,000 * 90% * 30% * 40% * 375ml = 1296 litres\\nTherefore, we can assume approximately 1,300 litres of Pepsi is sold in an IPL match in the Wankhede stadium.Most guesstimates don’t \\nfall under a specific \\nindustry, hence an open \\nmind always helps \\n200Don’t Do Coke\\nFramework \\n▪What type of a cricket \\nmatch is it?\\n▪Accounting for \\ndifferent factors while \\narriving at % of people \\nthat purchase soft \\ndrinks at the stadium\\n▪Asking about the \\nweatherClarifying Questions\\nBrownie PointsAMOUNT OF PEPSI SOLD\\n▪Such a guesstimate \\ncame about after \\ndiscussion with the \\nInterviewer.
